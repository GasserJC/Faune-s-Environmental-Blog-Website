                p(style="width: 50%") Hi! My name is Faune Fisher and I am a passionate environmental science student looking to change the world. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Resource Management. My current journey has shown me many things that have resulted in many personal changes. For example, just this year I went vegetarian and then vegan. I am learning a lot of incredible information all at once that I so desperately wish to share, hence the creation of my blog! Not only do I have a love for the environment, I also enjoy good and healthy food, cooking, and animals (especially dogs). I hope the information I provide here will make a difference in your life just as it did in mine.
