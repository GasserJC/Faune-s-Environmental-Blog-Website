<strong>Happy Veganuary!</strong> I am a little late I know, but it’s never too late to try vegan! Whether you are committing to the whole month, a few days, or even just a few meals, it will make a difference. Eating more plant based, fully or not, makes a significant difference in your health and the environment. You do not have to be vegan in order to eat vegan meals... seriously! They are easy, delicious, and a great way to get in your veggies! Don’t know where to start? This is where Veganuary comes in.
<br/><br/>
<h2><strong>Veganuary: What is it?</strong></h2>
What is Veganuary you ask? Well, a simple Google search will tell you that it is an annual challenge to eat vegan for the whole month of January. This challenge was started by the UK non-profit organization called Veganuary. They dedicate their time to educating people and promoting veganism. Their website is full of helpful tips, recipes, and ways to get involved in the movement. 
<br/><br/>
<h2><strong>How to start?</strong></h2>

Changing what you eat and what you make can be incredibly overwhelming. Everything is so new and different; how do you start? When making such a big change, it is always best to start slow. Chances are if you run into it too fast, it gets overwhelming and hard to the point where you give it up. 
<br/><br/>

First things first, look into alternatives to your current non-vegan items. For example, there are a ton of alternatives to milk, butter, yogurt, and even meat. There are many different plant-based milks such as almond, soy, coconut, oat, cashew, and macadamia. My favorites are oat and soy. They are both incredibly versatile and creamy and make great yogurts.

<br/><br/>
The next thing to do is find a plethora of recipes that interest you. Start with veganizing your staple meals. Once you have gotten in the groove of things, start exploring! The best thing about being vegan is that your choices are never ending. Veganism is not a restrictive diet whatsoever. It is better to think about all the things you can have rather than the things you cannot. I have personally discovered endless new foods, flavors, and seasonings! I have uncovered my love for Indian food along my wonderful journey.
<br/><br/>
A good thing to think about is where to shop. There are many good places to shop for fresh produce. As far as finding fresh produce along with vegan alternatives, there is actually a pretty extensive list: Woodman’s, Target, Aldi, Hy-vee, Pick N Save, Kroger, Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe’s, Costco, even Walmart, and if you’re a fellow Wisconsinite, Willy Street Co-op based in Madison. 
<br/><br/>
<h2><strong>Vegan Pantry Staples</strong></h2>
<strong>Plant milk</strong> (oat, soy, cashew, coconut, almond, or macadamia)- unsweetened for cooking and sweetened and/or flavored for a delicious drink or smoothie.
<br/><br/>
<img class="floated-right" src="../fav.jpg"/>
<strong>Plant butter</strong>- country crock is a great, affordable brand. Plant butter can be used in recipes, on toast, or sautéing some veggies.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Maple syrup</strong>- go for the pure maple syrup! Maple syrup is a great vegan sweetener. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Soy sauce</strong>- soy sauce is the base of pretty much every stir fry sauce. Making your own stir fry sauce for stir fry is the best as you can tweak the flavors included. Soy sauce is also an easy way to add salty goodness to rice, noodles, or other simple recipes. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Peanut butter</strong>- go for the natural peanut butter! Costco has a great organic peanut butter that is just peanuts and sea salt. Transitioning to this peanut butter is an adjustment, but it is worth cutting out the added sugars and corn syrup. Peanut butter is packed with healthy fats and protein and can be a great snack paired with fruit or spread on some toast with banana for a protein-packed breakfast.  
<br/><br/>
<strong>Chickpeas/garbanzo beans or any legume</strong>- chickpeas, or any legume really, is a great way to get protein.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Quinoa</strong>- quinoa is one of the few plant-based complete proteins which is a major must! Protein is made up of different amino acids. Our body produces all the amino acids accept nine, the “essential” amino acids. A “complete” protein is a food that contains all nine of the essential amino acids. Meat is a popular complete protein, but not the only one. Quinoa is also exceptionally versatile as it can be made sweet or savory. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Whole wheat bread/bagels</strong>- sandwiches and toast are easy and provide endless combination possibilities. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Whole wheat flour</strong>- there is a possibility that white all-purpose flour is not vegan due to the use of bone char to bleach the flour. Going for a whole wheat flour is a great way to avoid this and it is substantially healthier.
