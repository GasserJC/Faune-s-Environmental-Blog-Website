I believe our biggest harm towards our planet is overconsumption. The more we buy; the more resources are needed to manufacture, package, and transport. 
The more we buy; the more objects are thrown away. The more we buy; the more our environment is infiltrated with harmful substances. 
We buy all these items without thinking about whether we need them or not. We buy all these items thinking it is what we are supposed to do. 
Our overconsumption not only hurts the environment, it also hurts our mental well-being.

Our overconsumption and our desire for more does not fulfill the illusion of happiness buying gives.  
Even though we are told by marketers and society that we need certain objects, we end up not needing them at all. 
We are given the false feeling of satisfaction that ends up fading away after we purchase items. 
Being minimalistic, however, does not mean we have to give up things we enjoy. 
After watching the documentary Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things directed by Matt D’Avella, 
The Minimalists say being a minimalist means we only have items that give us value. 
The measurement of value can vary from person to person, object to object.

<br/><br/>

The point of the matter is to only have belongings that fulfill a meaningful person in our lives. 
In order for America and even the world to become minimalistic, there needs to be a drastic change in societal norms. 
Americans make up less than 5% of the world’s population yet according to the Frontier Group we account for more than 30% of the world’s waste. 
After acknowledging this piece of information, it is hard to say we do not have a problem. 
The first step towards minimalism and the first step towards being more environmentally aware is thinking before you buy. 

<br/><br/>

If you stop and think, ‘Do I really need this?’ or ‘Is this going to bring value to my life?’ or even 
‘Am I getting this because I want it or someone else is telling me I want it?’ To take a more environmental awareness approach, 
you can think to yourself ‘Where is this going to end up when I am done with it?’ or ‘Can I reuse or recycle it?’ If no is the answer 
to either of those questions, you should probably reassess how much you need it or if you can find a friendlier alternative.
